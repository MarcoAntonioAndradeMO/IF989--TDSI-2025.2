Abstract:	The increasing integration of intelligent robotic systems into human work environments has intensified the adoption of multifunctional robots capable of performing heterogeneous tasks and collaborating directly with humans. Despite the growing body of research on human–robot collaboration, the existing literature remains fragmented across application domains and lacks a consolidated understanding of multifunctional robotic systems. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review aimed at synthesizing the state of the art regarding the applications, enabling technologies, impacts, and challenges of multifunctional robots in logistics, healthcare, and field services. Following PRISMA guidelines, studies published between 2020 and 2025 were systematically identified, screened, and assessed across major scientific databases, resulting in a final set of 58 high-quality articles. The analysis reveals that multifunctional robots consistently contribute to improvements in productivity, safety, and ergonomics, while also highlighting persistent challenges related to trust, safety assurance, and organizational adoption. The findings provide a comprehensive overview of current research and identify directions for future studies focused on the effective and human-centered integration of multifunctional robots in real-world environments.
